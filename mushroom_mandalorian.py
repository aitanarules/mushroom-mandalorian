            Here are some common places where you can find mushrooms:
            * Forests: Look around decaying wood, tree roots, and leaf litter.
            * Meadows and grasslands: Mushrooms often grow in grassy areas, especially after rainfall.
            * Gardens and yards: Check damp, shaded spots in your garden or backyard.
